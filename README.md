## "Creating a registration form."
------------------------------------
YouTube Videos I Used:
* [React JS Form Validation | Axios User Registration Form Submit | Beginners to Intermediate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brcHK3P6ChQ&ab_channel=DaveGray)

During my bootcamp's introductory course we learned about accessibility and how important it is, so I'm glad I found a tutorial that kept it in mind.

In Dave's video, he uses live validation while typing. I researched some popular companies and they all took a different approach. For example, Google doesn't check the username input until after it's out of focus and doesn't check the password input until after the form's been submitted. There are many ways to do one thing and everyone has an opinion on why theirs is better.


What I Learned: There's a lot you need to take into consideration for any feature, no matter how simple it may seem. I think we take good user experience for granted because that's just what we have come to expect nowadays.
