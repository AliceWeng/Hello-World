[How to (really) remove eventListeners in React](https://dev.to/marcostreng/how-to-really-remove-eventlisteners-in-react-3och) | removeEventListener must be passed an event and a named function that match the addEventListener you want to remove.

I learned that the useCallback hook can prevent my functions from rerendering by passing them an empty dependency array.
